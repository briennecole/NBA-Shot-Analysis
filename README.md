# NBA_Shot_Analysis
### Group 3 Project Proposal
- Project Title: NBA SHOT ANALYSIS (working title)
- Members: Charlie Loveall, Pete Johnson, Brienne Cole, Chelsea Chaussee
- Project Description/Outline: Using 2014-2015 NBA shot clock data to answer several questions
- Research Questions to Answer: see project ideas
- Datasets to be used: shot_logs.csv from Kaggle
- Rough breakdown of tasks: Brienne â€“ git repo creator/ question/graph creating
		            Charlie -scrub data
			    Pete- question/formatting/graph creating
			    Chelsea-question/graph creating
			    
			    


### Project Ideas:
- Shot clock data, lots of ideas:
	1. Success rate vs time on clock
	2. Defender distance vs success rate
		- Or see who won defensive player of the year
		- 2pt distance vs success rate
		- 3pt distance vs success rate
		- Game clock vs success rate

### Hypotheses
- Shot Clock vs. Success Rate
	- Null: No relation between shot clock and success rate
	- Alternative: With 5 seconds or less the reduction in success rate of any shot is statistically significant 

- Defender distance
	- Null: Defender distance does not affect success rate.
	- Alternative: As defender distance increases, shot success rate increases.
	

## Notes
# ----------------------
- shot clock rule changed in 2018-2019 season for offensive rebounds: clock reset changed from 24 to 14 seconds.
